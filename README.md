# Life is a Box of Chocolate

## Packing a Box
Consider a packing company that would like to figure out how many of it's famous chocolate cubes will fit into a box of dimensions *boxLength* &times; *boxWidth* &times; *boxHeight*.  The company would also like to know what percentage of the space in the box is unusable (i.e. unused space).  The company needs to hire a programmer to write a program that could provide them with answers given any box or chocolate dimensions.

Your mission, should you choose it [*actually, you have no choice in the matter!*] is to write a program that provides such answers. 

First, obtain values for the box dimensions:

```
Provide box length (meters):
1
Provide box width (meters):
2
Provide box height (meters):
2
```

**NOTE:** *The input is provided here for clarity.   The output on this recitation should not show any of the values that were provided as input*

Next, obtain values for the length of sides of a chocolate cube:

```
Provide box length (meters):
1
Provide box width (meters):
2
Provide box height (meters):
2
Provide length of sides of chocolate cube (centimeters):
7
```

Now, calculate how many chocolate cubes will fit in the box such that, the total volume of all cubes do not exceed the volume of the box.

```
Provide box length (meters):
1
Provide box width (meters):
2
Provide box height (meters):
2
Provide length of sides of chocolate cube (centimeters):
7

The box will fit a maximum of 11661 chocolate cubes.

```

Next, you will need to figure out the amount of space in the box that is not used.

```
Provide box length (meters):
1
Provide box width (meters):
2
Provide box height (meters):
2
Provide length of sides of chocolate cube (centimeters):
7

The box will fit a maximum of 10976 chocolate cubes.
And will have 235232.0 cm^3 of unused space!
```
